Challenge test number 2 - Contact List

This revision is almost complete.
The docker containers are ok, the swagger is also ok and the flyway looks like ok too.
The unit tests are working better now. Now, there are two different profiles (test and dev).
I would like to implement some validations on dtos using spring validation, but I had no time to finish it.

Now, to execute the application, use the docker-compose tool to compile and run ;)

```docker-compose up```
